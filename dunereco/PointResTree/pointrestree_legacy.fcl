# A script to run an analysis module: PointResTree. You may want to
# compare this script with ${LARSIM_DIR}/job/prodsingle.fcl; in
# particular, in this script there are no output streams because the
# module doesn't write any events, just histograms or n-tuples.

# See <https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/larsoftsvn/wiki/Running_Jobs> for 
# more information on the structure of .fcl files. 

# The following line will have to be changed to match your experiment;
# e.g., "services_dune.fcl", "services_microboone.fcl".
# Here we pick the relevant services and the FHiCL files with their
# configurations one by one, according to what is directly used in
# PointResTree plus a bit of knowledge about what each service depends on
#
#include "geometry_dune.fcl"
#include "messageservice.fcl"
#include "services_dune.fcl"
#include "calorimetry_dune10kt.fcl"

services:
{
  # Load the service that manages root files for histograms.
  # Any histograms or n-tuples that you create in the program will be
  # written to this file. You can override the file name with the -T
  # option on the command line; e.g.,
  #  lar -c pointrestree.fcl -T myhistograms.root -s myinput.root

  # This constrols the display in the output of how long each job step

  # write some LogInfo messages in the analysis module for
  # demonstration purposes.

  # - Geometry service:
  #   provides information about the geometry of the detector and the mapping
  #   of TPC channels to the wires.
  #   Needed by PointResTree module; from larcore/Geometry/geometry_dune.fcl .

  #
  # - Geometry service helper:
  #   used internally by Geometry to set up the channel mappings.
  #   Needed by Geometry service; from larcore/Geometry/geometry_dune.fcl .
  WireReadout: @local::dune_wire_readout
